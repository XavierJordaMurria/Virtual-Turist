/**
 * When "upgrading" this class to an NSManaged class (i started with a non-Core Data MKAnnotation-conforming object and converted it to Core Data later in development),
 * it was neccessary to remove the inheritance from NSObject (which was initially added to allow for MKAnnotation protocol conformance); i wanted to have this class conform to the 
 * MKAnnotation protocol so that these objects, when returned from core data, could be used immediately as annotations on the map 
 * (rather than having to create an intermediate set of annotations from objects of a non-MKannotation conforming class).
